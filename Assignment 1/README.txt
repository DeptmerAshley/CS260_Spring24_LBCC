1. Representing marbles

I will be representing marbels by color. I will also have 3 different sizes, S, M, and L.

2. Method of adding marbles

I think I will be using a class to be able to create any number of marbles. 
I will also likely be making a class for the bag.

3. Method of deleting marbles

Deleting the marbles should be just as simple as adding them by having a delete function in the class.

4. Implementation

I think I would like to use print statemetns in a log file. 
The user will have the option of asking the program how many marbles are in the bag and also have 
access to a log file after the program.
